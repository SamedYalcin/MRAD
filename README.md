# MRAD (Maritime Reflection Analysis Dataset)

The code in this repository is released under MIT license.

We do not share the images in the dataset. Instead, we share URLs to the original sources.

We also share masks that you can use to reconstruct the inpainted versions of the images, along with the reconstruction code.
